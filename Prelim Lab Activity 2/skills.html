      <p class="profile-text">
        As a dedicated college student pursuing a career in web development, I am continuously building my skills in both frontend and backend technologies.
        I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly websites and exploring modern tools that enhance performance and design.
        Throughout my academic projects, I have developed a strong interest in problem-solving and building clean, efficient code.
        My goal is to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and eventually contribute to real-world projects where I can create meaningful and engaging digital experiences.
